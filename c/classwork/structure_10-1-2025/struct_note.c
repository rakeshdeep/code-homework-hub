// What is union?
// union is a user-defined data type that allows you to store different data types in the same memory location.
// You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time.
// Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
// The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union.
// The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the union.
// Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.
// Unions are used to define the structure of a variable in which you can store different data types.
// Unions are similar to structures because they allow you to store data members of different data types.
// what is struct?
// A structure is a user-defined data type in C/C++. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type.
// Structure helps to construct a complex data type which is more meaningful.
// A structure can contain any data type including array and another structure.
// A structure can be initialized at the time of declaration.
// syntax:
// struct structure_name
// {
//     data_type member1;
//     data_type member2;
//     .
//     .
//     .
//     data_type memberN;
// }; 
// struct structure_name object_name;
